This is a set of scripts for running post-installation tasks for Debian. It is
intended primarily to set up a Cinnamon or, to a lesser extent, GNOME desktop
environment.

Order of installations:

0. script dependencies
1. base, grsec, utils, zsh
2. desktop environment (cinnamon, gnome)
3. apps, codecs, dev, network, emulators, vms
4. installing themes and fonts
5. personalization, (g/d)conf settings
